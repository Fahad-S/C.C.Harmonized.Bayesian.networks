    """

    Function that trains the model subject to various fairness constraints.
    If no constraints are given, then simply trains an unaltered classifier.
    Example usage in: "synthetic_data_demo/decision_boundary_demo.py"

    ----

    Inputs:

    X: (n) x (d+1) numpy array -- n = number of examples, d = number of features, one feature is the intercept
    y: 1-d numpy array (n entries)
    x_control: dictionary of the type {"s": [...]}, key "s" is the sensitive feature name, and the value is a 1-d list with n elements holding the sensitive feature values
    loss_function: the loss function that we want to optimize -- for now we have implementation of logistic loss, but other functions like hinge loss can also be added
    apply_fairness_constraints: optimize accuracy subject to fairness constraint (0/1 values)
    apply_accuracy_constraint: optimize fairness subject to accuracy constraint (0/1 values)
    sep_constraint: apply the fine grained accuracy constraint
        for details, see Section 3.3 of arxiv.org/abs/1507.05259v3
        For examples on how to apply these constraints, see "synthetic_data_demo/decision_boundary_demo.py"
    Note: both apply_fairness_constraints and apply_accuracy_constraint cannot be 1 at the same time
    sensitive_attrs: ["s1", "s2", ...], list of sensitive features for which to apply fairness constraint, all of these sensitive features should have a corresponding array in x_control
    sensitive_attrs_to_cov_thresh: the covariance threshold that the classifier should achieve (this is only needed when apply_fairness_constraints=1, not needed for the other two constraints)
    gamma: controls the loss in accuracy we are willing to incur when using apply_accuracy_constraint and sep_constraint

    ----

    Outputs:

    w: the learned weight vector for the classifier
